## Quick goals

- Clean, modular OOP design (`Puzzle`, `Board`, `Cell` classes).
- Robust solver using backtracking and constraint checks.
- Generator that creates valid puzzles and uses a small AI model for difficulty estimation and variety.
- File handling for saving/loading puzzles (plain text and JSON).
- Streamlit app for interactive UI and deployment to Streamlit Cloud.
- Development workflow using VS Code, Google Colab for AI training, and GitHub for version control.
